# Neurodegeneration

Neurodegeneration refers to progressive loss of structure or function of neurons.
Key contributors include oxidative stress, protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and microglial activation.

## Hallmarks

- Accumulation of misfolded proteins
- Impaired proteostasis
- Oxidative stress
- Mitochondrial dysfunction

## Microglia

Microglia act as the resident immune cells of the central nervous system and can contribute to neuroinflammation.

### Synaptic Changes

Synaptic loss is an early event in neurodegenerative diseases, often preceding neuronal death and correlating with cognitive decline.
