Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled examples
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with environment

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
